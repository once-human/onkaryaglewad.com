Add your `head.png` image here.

Recommended location: public/assets/head.png
Recommended format: PNG (or WebP/AVIF for smaller sizes)
Suggested size: a 16:9 image suitable for laptop screens (e.g., 1920x1080 or 1600x900). The page will center the image and preserve its aspect ratio.

Notes:
- The page will not stretch the image; it uses `object-fit: contain` so the full image is visible.
- The image will have a 24px gap on all sides and rounded corners.

After adding the file, commit and push it (or upload via your Git provider). If you want me to add a placeholder image, tell me and I'll add a small example file.
